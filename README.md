[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/henriquevcosta/rserve-caret.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/henriquevcosta/rserve-caret)

Docker container running RServe with caret installed

This is based on [stevenpollack/docker-rserve](https://github.com/stevenpollack/docker-rserve) but adds a lot of machine learning model capabilities using caret.
